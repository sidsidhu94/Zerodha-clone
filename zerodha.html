            Attention investors: 1) Stock brokers can accept securities as
             margins from clients only by way of pledge in the depository 
             system w.e.f September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and 
             phone number with your stock broker / depository participant and 
             receive OTP directly from depository on your e-mail and/or mobile
              number to create pledge. 3) Check your securities / MF / bonds 
              in the consolidated account statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month. <br>
            
            "Prevent unauthorised transactions in your account. Update your 
            mobile numbers/email IDs with your stock brokers. Receive information
             of your transactions directly from Exchange on your mobile/email 
             at the end of the day. Issued in the interest of investors. KYC 
             is one time exercise while dealing in securities markets - once 
             KYC is done through a SEBI registered intermediary (broker, DP, 
             Mutual Fund etc.), you need not undergo the same process again 
             when you approach another intermediary." Dear Investor, 
             if you are subscribing to an IPO, there is no need to
              issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number 
              and sign the IPO application form to authorize your bank 
              to make payment in case of allotment. In case of non allotment 
              the funds will remain in your bank account. As a business we
               don't give stock tips, and have not authorized anyone to 
               trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone claiming to
                be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
